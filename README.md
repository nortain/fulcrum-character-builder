### Other docker info
Ideall this stuff should work but it doesn\'t yet :(
To run a project generated from the Angular CLI in nginx do the following:

Run `ng build --delete-output-path false`    (or use -dop)<br>
cd into the "dist" folder<br>
Run the following command:

`docker run -d -p 4200:4200 -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app nginx:alpine`

Note: The Angular CLI currently deletes the "dist" folder and recreates it when running ng build so if you run it again the volume defined above won't work correctly.

### Docker commands
 	
     docker pull [imageName]
     docker images
     docker rmi [imageID]
